TO COMPILE AND RUN CODE: The project was created in APACHE NETBEANS IDE 11.2. It is a Java with ANT Java application, which means it should be able to compile on older versions of Netbeans (Java with Maven for example would throw a compiler error with older versions). There are no compiler or syntax errors present, so if you encounter one, please double check the NETBEANS version although you should not have any issues. To run the code, open the project in NETBEANS, open lab5, open Source Packages -> lab5 -> Villains.java then simply run this file, or find Run in the toolbar -> Run File. A menu will appear in the command line output for you to interact with the program. Enlarge this window to view comfortably.

!!!IMPORTANT!!!: one of the menu options (number 15) when entered safely terminates the session. This option was added because as I was testing different versions of the code, older versions did not close connections properly and that was causing the database to lock for different sessions. There was nothing wrong with my updated code, it was simply because the connections opened from the previous versions of my code did not properly close the connection and the sessions were not terminated by simply stopping the program. I had to close the project and Netbeans completely then open again for it to reset. The command line takes in numbers only. If you enter a number greater than 15 or less than 1 it will tell you to select between 1 and 15. If you enter a character or symbol the build will fail. Do not enter any letters or symbols. Only numbers. 

The JAR file is included in the project folder and is included in the project library. If somehow you donâ€™t find it inside Libraries in the project navigation on NETBEANS and it throws an error, just right click Libraries folder inside NETBEANS in the project navigation and select Add JAR, then select the JAR file in the lab5 folder I provided.
